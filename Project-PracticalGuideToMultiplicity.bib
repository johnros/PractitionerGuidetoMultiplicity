This procedure is designed to deal with signal that is continuous and has, in principle, unbounded spatial support. We therefore infer on topological features of the signal, such as the existence of local maxima or peaks above some threshold. Using results from random field theory, we assign a p-value to each maximum in an {SPM} and identify an adaptive threshold that controls false discovery rate, using the Benjamini and Hochberg ({BH)} procedure (1995). This provides a natural complement to conventional family wise error ({FWE)} control on local maxima. We use simulations to contrast these procedures; both in terms of their relative number of discoveries and their spatial accuracy (via the distribution of the Euclidian distance between true and discovered activations). We also assessed two other procedures: cluster-wise and voxel-wise {FDR} procedures. Our results suggest that (a) {FDR} control of maxima or peaks is more sensitive than {FWE} control of peaks with minimal cost in terms of false-positives, (b) voxel-wise {FDR} is substantially less accurate than topological {FWE} or {FDR} control.

Whereas we typically control the type I error rate for a single-hypothesis test, a compound error rate is controlled for multiple-hypothesis tests. For example, controlling the false discovery rate {FDR} traditionally involves intricate sequential p-value rejection methods based on the observed data. Whereas a sequential p-value method fixes the error rate and estimates its corresponding rejection region, we propose the opposite approach2014we fix the rejection region and then estimate its corresponding error rate. This new approach offers increased applicability, accuracy and power. We apply the methodology to both the positive false discovery rate {pFDR} and {FDR}, and provide evidence for its benefits. It is shown that {pFDR} is probably the quantity of interest over {FDR.} Also discussed is the calculation of the q-value, the {pFDR} analogue of the p-value, which eliminates the need to set the error rate beforehand as is traditionally done. Some simple numerical examples are presented that show that this new approach can yield an increase of over eight times in power compared with the {Benjamini2013Hochberg} {FDR} method.},

Recent advances in neuroimaging and genetics have allowed collection of both highly detailed structural brain scans and genome-wide genotype information. This wealth of information presents a new opportunity to find the genes influencing brain structure. Here we explore the relation between 448,293 single nucleotide polymorphisms in each of 31,622 voxels of the entire brain across 740 elderly subjects (mean age\&\#xa0;{\^A}{\textpm}\&\#xa0;s.d.: 75.52\&\#xa0;{\^A}{\textpm}\&\#xa0;6.82{\^A}~years; 438 male) including subjects with Alzheimer's disease, Mild Cognitive Impairment, and healthy elderly controls from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative ({ADNI).} We used tensor-based morphometry to measure individual differences in brain structure at the voxel level relative to a study-specific template based on healthy elderly subjects. We then conducted a genome-wide association at each voxel to identify genetic variants of interest. By studying only the most associated variant at each voxel, we developed a novel method to address the multiple comparisons problem and computational burden associated with the unprecedented amount of data. No variant survived the strict significance criterion, but several genes worthy of further exploration were identified, including {CSMD2} and {CADPS2.} These genes have high relevance to brain structure. This is the first voxelwise genome wide association study to our knowledge, and offers a novel method to discover genetic influences on brain structure.},

The probability that a research claim is true may depend on study power and bias, the number of other studies on the same question, and, importantly, the ratio of true to no relationships among the relationships probed in each scientific field. In this framework, a research finding is less likely to be true when the studies conducted in a field are smaller; when effect sizes are smaller; when there is a greater number and lesser preselection of tested relationships; where there is greater flexibility in designs, definitions, outcomes, and analytical modes; when there is greater financial and other interest and prejudice; and when more teams are involved in a scientific field in chase of statistical significance. Simulations show that for most study designs and settings, it is more likely for a research claim to be false than true. Moreover, for many current scientific fields, claimed research findings may often be simply accurate measures of the prevailing bias. In this essay, I discuss the implications of these problems for the conduct and interpretation of research.},

	abstract = {This article shows that any single-step or stepwise multiple testing procedure (asymptotically) controlling the family-wise error rate ({FWER)} can be augmented into procedures that (asymptotically) control tail probabilities for the number of false positives and the proportion of false positives among the rejected hypotheses. Specifically, given any procedure that (asymptotically) controls the {FWER} at level alpha, we propose simple augmentation procedures that provide (asymptotic) level-alpha control of: (i) the generalized family-wise error rate, i.e., the tail probability, {gFWER(k)}, that the number of Type I errors exceeds a user-supplied integer k, and (ii) the tail probability, {TPPFP(q)}, that the proportion of Type I errors among the rejected hypotheses exceeds a user-supplied value 0{\textless}q{\textless}1. Existing approaches for control of the proportion of false positives typically rely on the assumption that the test statistics are independent, while our proposed augmentation procedures control the {gFWER} and {TPPFP} for general data generating distributions, with arbitrary dependence structures among variables. Applying the augmentation methods to step-down multiple testing procedures that control the {FWER} asymptotically exactly at level alpha (van der Laan et al., 2004), yields procedures that also provide exact asymptotic control of the {gFWER} and {TPPFP} at level alpha. The adjusted p-values for the {gFWER} and {TPPFP-controlling} augmentation procedures are shown to be simple functions of the adjusted p-values for the original {FWER-controlling} procedure. Finally, two simple conservative procedures are proposed for controlling the false discovery rate.},

These confuse the users of our methodology and pose a threat. To avoid the threat, it is our responsibility to match our theoretical goals to the goals of the users of statistics. Only then should we match the methods to the theoretical goals. Considerations related to such needs are discussed: simultaneous inference or selective inference, testing or estimation, decision making or scientific reporting. I then further argue that the vitality of our field in the future {\textendash} as a research area {\textendash} depends upon our ability to continue and address the real needs of statistical analyses in current problems.

	volume = {32},
	issn = {0090-5364},
	doi = {10.1214/009053604000000265},
	abstract = {Higher criticism, or second-level significance testing, is a multiple-comparisons concept mentioned in passing by Tukey. It concerns a situation where there are many independent tests of significance and one is interested in rejecting the joint null hypothesis. Tukey suggested comparing the fraction of observed significances at a given alpha-level to the expected fraction under the joint null. In fact, he suggested standardizing the difference of the two quantities and forming a z-score; the resulting z-score tests the significance of the body of significance tests.   We consider a generalization, where we maximize this z-score over a range of significance levels 0 {\textless} \&alpha; {\&LE;} \&alpha;(0). We are able to show that the resulting higher critic-ism statistic is effective at resolving a very subtle testing problem: testing whether n normal means are all zero versus the alternative that a small fraction is nonzero.   The subtlety of this "sparse normal means" testing problem can be seen from work of Ingster and Jin, who studied such problems in great detail. In their Studies, they identified an interesting range of cases where the small fraction of nonzero means is so small that the alternative hypothesis exhibits little noticeable effect on the distribution of the p-values either for the bulk of the tests or for the few most highly significant tests. In this range, when the amplitude of nonzero means is calibrated with the fraction of nonzero means, the likelihood ratio test for a precisely specified alternative would still succeed in separating the two hypotheses.   We show that the higher criticism is successful throughout the same region of amplitude sparsity where the likelihood ratio test would succeed. Since it does not require a specification of the alternative, this shows that higher criticism is in a sense optimally adaptive to unknown sparsity and size of the nonnull effects. While our theoretical work is largely asymptotic, we provide Simulations in finite samples and suggest some possible applications. We also show that higher critcism works well over a range of non-Gaussian cases.},

	abstract = {The question of what significance threshold is appropriate for genomewide association studies is somewhat unresolved. Previous theoretical suggestions have yet to be validated in practice, whereas permutation testing does not resolve a discrepancy between the genomewide multiplicity of the experiment and the subset of markers actually tested. We used genotypes from the Wellcome Trust Case-Control Consortium to estimate a genomewide significance threshold for the {UK} Caucasian population. We subsampled the genotypes at increasing densities, using permutation to estimate the nominal P-value for 5\% family-wise error. By extrapolating to infinite density, we estimated the genomewide significance threshold to be about 7.2 {\texttimes} 10-8. To reduce the computation time, we considered Patterson's eigenvalue estimator of the effective number of tests, but found it to be an order of magnitude too low for multiplicity correction. However, by fitting a Beta distribution to the minimum P-value from permutation replicates, we showed that the effective number is a useful heuristic and suggest that its estimation in this context is an open problem. We conclude that permutation is still needed to obtain genomewide significance thresholds, but with subsampling, extrapolation and estimation of an effective number of tests, the threshold can be standardized for all studies of the same population.},
